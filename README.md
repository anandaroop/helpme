# RLM

Sandbox for playing with **RubyLLM** ([repo](https://github.com/crmne/ruby_llm), [docs](https://rubyllm.com)), a promising, concise API for LLM usage via Ruby.

Currently contains the following.

### `helpme`

A CLI for CLIs.

Use it to express in natural language what you want from:

- `ffmpeg`
- ImageMagick's `convert`
- or other CLI utilities.

See its [system prompt](https://github.com/anandaroop/rlm/blob/83fb940191cb808cc64d7584cc4c0fae5653baea/helpme#L38-L52) to get the gist.
